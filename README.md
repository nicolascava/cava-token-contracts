# Cava Token Contracts

> Ethereum smart contracts for the Cava ERC20 token

> ‚ùå Sorry, but this library is no longer maintained. Please find an alternative.

## Summary

Experimentation on a [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org) ERC20 token. This codebase owns the smart contracts that define the Cava ERC20 token in the Ethereum blockchain.

Smart contracts handle the token definition and the crowdsale definition. The entire project is built on the [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com) framework, necessary to test, compile, and deploy smart contracts with ease. With Truffle, smart contracts deployment are done like database migrations in a traditional deployment flow.

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org) is used to perform unit tests on the smart contracts. I test using [Ganache](http://truffleframework.com/ganache), a private Ethereum blockchain.

A deployment pipeline is set on the [Ropsten](https://ropsten.etherscan.io) testnet, to emulate as close as possible the Ethereum mainnet.
